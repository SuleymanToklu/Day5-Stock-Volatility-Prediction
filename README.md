# ðŸ“ˆ Day 5: Stock Volatility Prediction

This is the fifth project of my #30DaysOfAI challenge. The goal is to build a regression model that predicts the future volatility of a stock.

### âœ¨ Key Concepts
* **Time Series Forecasting:** Working with time-dependent data.
* **Feature Engineering for Time Series:** Creating features like lags and moving averages from historical data.
* **Live Data with APIs:** Using the `yfinance` library to fetch up-to-date stock data, making the application dynamic and real-world relevant.

### ðŸ’» Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Streamlit, yfinance

### ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Train the model: `python train_model.py`
3. Run the app: `streamlit run app.py`
